In 2019, I decided that I was going to quit my job and do a little bit of traveling, culminating in a summer spent set netting for salmon on the Kenai Pensinsula in Alaska. I already owned a Ford Ranger with a hard top canopy and roof rack on it. I wanted to build out the availaable space into something that I could travel/live in for an extended period of time.

It's a pretty small space, so I had to try to maximize storage as much as possible, while still allowing me to spend time inside it without being claustrophobic. In order to do this, I built the sleeping platform in pieces so I could stack them during the day to have more floor to ceiling space.

In addition to the minimal vertical space, the bed is 6' long and I'm 6'3". I saw a YouTube video (add link) where someone had a fold-up canopy extension that rested on the open tailgate to provide some extra space. I decided to make a version of that, but had to make it collapsible so that it wouldn't run into the boxes for the sleeping platform.

My travel plans got a little interrupted due to Covid, but I still made it up to Alaska. I spent the summer sleeping in the truck, but I had access to a larger trailer where we made food and ate. During my drives to and from Alaska I slept and ate out of the truck and I've also gone on a few multi-day trips. It's a great resource to be able to just pull over and have a place to sleep with no set up, but it's way too small to really do any sort of extended "living" in it. I'm pretty satisfied with the build overall and everything worked out how I envisioned it, but the minimal vertical space puts a real damper on the whole thing. When the drawers are stacked and I have floor-to-ceiling clearance, I still can't sit up completely straight.

I also think I could improve the outside area to make up for the minimal space. The canopy isn't easy to set up and I think making a roll-out canopy attached to the roof rack would be easier to set up and tear down. I also didn't have a chair or anything due to minimal storage. If i added a roof basket of some sort, I could carry a few more big things like that.
