For the interior of the camper, my main considerations were:

1. Decent sleeping surface area
1. As much storage as possible
1. Area to sit up straight as well as stretch my legs

I used the wheel wells to determine a lot of measurements. 
I wanted to keep the back area clear so that I could sit back there, so I made the side walls extend to just past the wells.
The side walls were split into two sections - the part above the wheel well would be accessed from above and the full-height area towards the tailgate would be accessed from the side or the back.
I split the space between the walls in half for the boxes that form the main section of the sleeping platform. 
I made one long, with a drawer, but I wanted the other side to be split in half so I could stack them on top of the long one.
I made a back wall with a lip on it and added lips to the backs of the boxes in order to hold the back section of the sleeping platform.
Because I wanted to store the sleeping platform relatively compactly, I needed to make indiviual cushions that could also be stacked, instead of a larger mattress pad.

I wanted to finish the ceiling in some way, both for looks and also for storage.
My original plan was to sew mesh pockets onto some carpet and line it with that.
That may have worked if I'd used some sort of carpet glue or strong adhesive, but the carpet tape was not nearly strong enough, unsurprisingly.
I breifly experimented with a wooden frame inside that would have rafters I could hang bags in.
Quickly realized that was too complicated and fragile and so I tried gluing some rafters to the ceiling.
The ceiling rafters worked great to smooth the ceiling humps in preparation for the cedar planks, but they also were too weak to hold bags. 
After installing the celing, I strung some cable up where the original cup hooks for the bags were, and hung them with S-hooks. This set up has worked out well so far.
