# Overview 

For the interior of the camper, my main considerations were:

1. Decent sleeping surface area
1. As much storage as possible
1. Area to sit up straight as well as stretch my legs

I used the wheel wells to determine a lot of measurements. 
I wanted to keep the back area clear so that I could sit back there, so I made the side walls extend to just past the wells.
The side walls were split into two sections - the part above the wheel well would be accessed from above and the full-height area towards the tailgate would be accessed from the side or the back.
I split the space between the walls in half for the boxes that form the main section of the sleeping platform. 
I made one long, with a drawer, but I wanted the other side to be split in half so I could stack them on top of the long one.
I made a back wall with a lip on it and added lips to the backs of the boxes in order to hold the back section of the sleeping platform.
Because I wanted to store the sleeping platform relatively compactly, I needed to make indiviual cushions that could also be stacked, instead of a larger mattress pad.

I wanted to finish the ceiling in some way, both for looks and also for storage.
My original plan was to sew mesh pockets onto some carpet and line it with that.
That may have worked if I'd used some sort of carpet glue or strong adhesive, but the carpet tape was not nearly strong enough, unsurprisingly.
I breifly experimented with a wooden frame inside that would have rafters I could hang bags in.
Quickly realized that was too complicated and fragile and so I tried gluing some rafters to the ceiling.
The ceiling rafters worked great to smooth the ceiling humps in preparation for the cedar planks, but they also were too weak to hold bags. 
After installing the celing, I strung some cable up where the original cup hooks for the bags were, and hung them with S-hooks. This set up has worked out well so far. 

# Sides

I cut rectangles to rest on the ~2" of the canopy/bed attachment and then extend in line with the inside of the wheel wells to meet up with the vertical part of the wall.
I cut out an opening in the top for access on the driver's side. 
For the passenger side, I originally just had the holes for the dog bowls, but ended up adding another lid opening next to it.

The side openings were a lot of trial and error. 
I wanted to experiment trying to make the doors without buying any hardware and I also wanted to divide the side opening in half, so that I could still open it when the drawers were in there.
Once I made the doors and glued in the dowel rods, I realized I couldn't install them in the wood without some sort of faceplate, so I routed out a section around the rim to put some trim up.
Now I can unscrew this when I want to take the doors off.

I also put some shelves in the back sections to maximize storage. On the driver side I have extra shoes and on the passenger I have my water tank, some tent poles, and the tarp for my canopy.

# Storage Boxes/Sleeping Platform

The central portion of the bed is taken up by some storage boxes that double as my sleeping platform.
As I mentioned above, I made these somewhat stackable so I could have more floor space.
I just cut plywood and glued and screwed these together.
I made a drawer for the large box and also made the back half of the box removable.
The two half-sized boxes have magnetic lids and one side is open with a button-on canvas cover.
I tried small neodymium magnets and they totally failed.
Got some stronger ones and have had trouble keeping them glued to the box because they're too strong.
I think if I spend some time clamping them glued with epoxy or something, they should hold fine. 
I cut out holes in the lids and also the boxes to make them easier to grab.

The boxes only extend to the front of the wheel well.
The very back is just empty space, I usually tuck my sleeping bag down there when I'm driving.
I made a headboard with cedar closet boards that has a ledge running across it where I place plywood planks that also rest on the boxes, making the full sleeping platform.

Everything worked as I planned, but the small headspace still made it feel cramped. The boxes were also a little heavy and unweildy to move around in such a tight space, but not particularly hard.

# Ceiling and Storage Bags

So I ended up cutting a bunch of small plywood pieces and gluing them onto the ceiling with contact cement.
The bottom-most piece sits into a little lip on the canopy with is the vertical support for them.
I also attached some metal brackets to span the different pieces. 
The plywood is decently attached, but you can't hang anything from it.
As soon as I added a bag, which hung from cuphooks in the plywood, it sagged from the middle.
Although it can't hold up the bags, it has been great holding up the cedar strips I cut for the ceiling.
The original ceiling had these crosswise humps every few feet that would have been difficult to use to glue the strips.
I got some cedar fence posts and planed them down pretty thin, then I cut them into a few different sizes.
The thinnest ones that I cut for the curve ended up warping because I didn't let them dry enough before planing and cutting so thinly.

Instead of hanging bags from those plywood rafters, I drilled through the front and back of the camper top and strung up cables using eye bolts and turnbuckles.
I attached s-hooks to this for the top part of the bag, but was able to just use the bottom cup hooks since they were attached so far down the bottom.
For the bags, I just sewed them closed with zippers and put some grommets on them.
